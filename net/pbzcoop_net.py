"""PBZCoop network relay: carries game state between two PCs over UDP (designed for Tailscale IPs).

The game mod and this relay talk through small text files in the mod folder:
  net_out.txt         written by the mod: the local snapshot, several lines (player "P ...", enemies "E ...")
  net_in.txt          written by the relay: the other side's latest snapshot (one peer)
  net_in_<peer>.txt   the same, one file per peer once a host has more than one guest (the mod reads both)
  net_events_out.txt  written by the mod: "S <session>" then one numbered event per line ("<id> <type> <args>")
  net_events_in.txt   written by the relay: the other side's events, in order, same format (net_events_in_<peer>.txt
                      per peer with more than one)
  net_status.txt      written by the relay: connection state, peer address, round-trip time, and "peers=<n>" with
                      one peer<n>=<address>,<up|gone>,<rtt> per peer when there is more than one

A host serves up to --max-players (2 by default: one host, one guest, exactly as before), star topology: guests
talk to the host and to nobody else, and the host passes on what the others need.

Snapshots are newest-wins: a lost packet is simply replaced by the next one 50 ms later.
Events (attacks, kills, pickups) are reliable: resent every tick until the peer acknowledges them.
The relay doesn't interpret either; only echo mode shifts the "P" line so the fake friend stands aside.

Usage:
  host:   python -I pbzcoop_net.py host   --dir <mod folder>
  client: python -I pbzcoop_net.py client --dir <mod folder> --peer 100.112.4.45
  echo:   python -I pbzcoop_net.py echo   --dir <mod folder>
          (no network: plays your own snapshot and events back, 3 m to the side and 0.3 s late, as a fake
          friend for solo testing)
  record: python -I pbzcoop_net.py record --dir <mod folder> --file host.jsonl       (mod as host)
  replay: python -I pbzcoop_net.py replay --dir <mod folder> --file host.jsonl --client-log client.txt
          (mod as client, ideally in a fresh game session: a recorded real host plays against the client)
